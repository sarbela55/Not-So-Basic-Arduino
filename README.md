# Not-So-Basic-Arduino

Assignment #1: Hello Functions
Focus: In this assignment, you have to get the arduino to rotate the servo motor according to readings from an ultrasonic sensor. Depending
on the distance from an object to the ultrasonic sensor, the servo will move a certian amount. The Aruinto had to be wired to a servo,
breadboard, and ultrasonic sensor. The function loop states that if the ultrasonic sensor picks up X amount of motion, move the servo X 
distance.

End Result:

Challenges: I had trouble coding this assignment, as I had rarely used functions. I had the code right, and all of the right data was
printing on the serial monitor, but it still wasn't working. I had to check back through everything just to find out that my arduino wasn't
working! This assignment took me the longest out of all of the assignments, probably because I had trouble focusing and I got very 
frustrated when I got stuck.
